Aim of project:
 - ESP32 obtains measurements of fluid flow (mL every 5 minutes) and builds a log by populating a float array
 - ESP32 works as an WiFi access point AP
 - Nearby device (i.e. a tablet), works as a display/dashboard for this data and can cause ESP32 to change modes
 - ESP32 uses LittleFS to separate code vs webfiles
 - The dashboard functionality and look is illustrated in the picture in the repo
